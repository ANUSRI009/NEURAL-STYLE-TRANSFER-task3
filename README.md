# NEURAL-STYLE-TRANSFER-task3
Project Overview

This project implements a neural style transfer model using TensorFlow and Keras. The model allows you to transfer the style of one image to another, creating a new image that combines the content of the original image with the style of the reference image.

Installation Instructions

To run this project, you'll need to install the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pillow
- NumPy

To install these libraries, follow these steps:

1. Install Python from the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Install pip, the package installer for Python.
3. Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt:
pip install tensorflow
pip install keras
pip install pillow
pip install numpy

4. Verify that the libraries are installed correctly by running:
import tensorflow as tf
import keras
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np
Usage

To use the neural style transfer model, simply run the Python script and provide the paths to the content and style images.

Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
